		<h1 class="heading">Thank you for everything</h1>
		<p>Thanks to everyone's contributions over the past few months, from just one pad to hundreds of dollars to generous shipments from all over the country and even Canada, we were able to raise 4,049 pads, 344 tampons, and 413 panty liners. This is no small feat and we could never have gotten this far without all of your support. We hope to continue raising awareness for the struggles of homeless women and any other underpriveleged groups. Nonetheless, we will continue to #FightFreeFlow.</p>
